afterglowpy
===========

*afterglowpy* is a Python package for modelling Gamma-ray burst afterglows. It computes synchrotron radiation from an external shock and is capable of handling both structured jets and off-axis observers.

For details of the physics, approximations, and numerical implementation please see `Ryan et al. 2019 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11691>`_.

You can install *afterglowpy* with pip::

    $ pip install afterglowpy
